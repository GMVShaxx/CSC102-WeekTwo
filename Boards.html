               <h4>NETWORK SECURITY DEGREE OBJECTIVES</h4>
                   
                <br>
               <h3> 1. Create a network infrastructure design communications document that includes identified hardware components,
                connections to the outside world, identified physical layer connectivity (media) and addressing, including operational and
                security components in the design.
                <!-- I place two breaks inbetween each objective so that it is easier to read -->
                <br><br>
                2. Install, configure and test security hardware and software tools with supporting documentation such as port scanners,
                vulnerability detection systems, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, system hardening, anti-virus tools, patch
                management, auditing and assessment.
                <br><br>
                3. Construct, implement and document a script or a program to automate a security-related process or other tasks such as
                installation, administration, management, mapping resources, logon scripts, patch management, updates, auditing,
                analysis and assessment.
                <br><br>
                4. Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as: a disaster recovery plan, a business continuity plan, an
                incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical security policy,
                assessments or troubleshooting procedures.
                <br><br>
                5. Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and mandated requirements
                that pertain to information security.
                <br>
                <br>
                6. Research, document, test and evaluate several current industry information security-based threats, risks, malicious
                activities, covert methodology, encryption technologies, mitigation techniques or unconventional tactics to prevent loss of
                sensitive information and data confidentiality, integrity and availability.
